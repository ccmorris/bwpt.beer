### Last Hurrah of Summer

On Wednesday, August 29th at 6:30pm we will be going to Canatara Park to take advantage of the great outdoor space that Sarnia has to offer and to enjoy the last of the summer!  
We will meet near the Mad Taco food truck which is located on the north side of the big field or at 1200 Lake Chipican Drive inside the park. We will get food from either Mad Taco or a fry truck and then enjoy the outdoors at the park. We can play beach volleyball if the courts and are available, else throw a Frisbee around or enjoy the lake.  
Hope to see everyone there.  

### Evening at Sarnia's newest patio - The Courtyard

Update: Despite the rainy weather and not getting to enjoy much of the patio, the evening was still a blast!

On July 5th at 7:30, BWPT will check out Sarnia's newest patio - The Courtyard which is located at 146 Christina Street N in Sarnia.  
Come joing us and enjoy the start of summer.
