### Axe Throwing
We have decided to give axe throwing a go at Sarnia's very own Valley Axe.  
Thursday, January 19, 2017 @ 7pm  
Must have a minimum of 4 people going for event to happen.  
$30/ person for 2.5-3 hours of axe throwing.  
RSVP with Heather or Natasha by no later than close of business Tuesday January 17th  

EDIT: Axe throwing went really well! It was a lot of fun with excellent instruction. Can't wait to do it again!


### Snowshoeing at the Pinery
Tentative date: February 11, 2017  
For this event we will be heading up to the pinery to go snowshoeing and skating.  
Snowshoes can be rented in the park.  
This event will largely depend on the weather.  
RSVP to Heather or Natasha if you are interested so we can coordinate.

EDIT: Unfortunately, due to the lack of snow, we were unable to host this event
