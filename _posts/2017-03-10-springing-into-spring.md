As we never got to host February's event due to lack of snow, we will be hosting 2 March events!

### Paint Party with The Painted Cat

For the first of our March events, we will be going to a Paint Party hosted by the Painted Cat!  
The paint party will be at zZas Pizza Bistro at 170 Christina Street N and will begin at 6:30pm sharp  
There will be a break half way through painting to eat while the background dries.  
Cost is $45 per person which gets you all necessary equipment including paint and canvas and step-by-step instruction on how to paint the particular painting  
To sign-up contact Cat Cabajar directly through the facebook group. Spots will be reserved by prepayment.
